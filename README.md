# Portfolio-Projects-SQL

In these projects, I represented data in the form of tables in a Relational Database to analyze business scenarios. 
I utilized Structured Query Language (SQL) to perform various operations on a database.
The main topics in these projects are: creating, updating, and retrieving data stored in MySQL (RDBMS) database. 
In the first assignment I created a database with tables and values. I altered, updated, and created a backup database.
In the second assignment, I filtered data by rows and columns, used functions to customize result set, sorted and grouped data.
In the third assignment, I retrieved data from multiple tables, used inner join to retrieve common data, and performed data retrieving process using outer join.
